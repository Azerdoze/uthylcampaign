                    <p>Tragedy, glory, loss and sorrow are what define a big portion of the human kingdom's history in Arthan Uthyl. From brief periods of peace with technological advancement, inside wars that shake the continent's society, to supernatural invasions, from both the unknown lands North and South. Not only that, various natural catastrophes ravage the land, tormenting the locals that, unrelentless, keep rising up against the impeding doom.</p>
                    <p>Little is known about the origins of the humans. What is known is that a long, long time ago, humans came from the seas, in a mighty fleet, reaching the shore of the current region of Nakolota. Why they came or what brought them here, no one knows. From there, history becomes messy. Strife between the various crew members divided the fleet and a exploration race took place, each crew party conquering land for themselves, thus the first human kingdoms were born.</p>
                    <p>The frist great kingdom belonged to the tribe of Zhuo. founding his reign in the vast and mystical land of Chientzy. There, they found a being of immense power and started worshipping it like a god. But there were some who saw such a being with disbelief. A veteran soldier named Khala Kun'dur made a small insurrection and departed with his followers to the lands East, founding the rocky kingdom of Lao-Tse. The Zhuo tribe, to avoid future threats, then built a huge fortification around the landscape, what is now known as the "Endless Wall".</p>

                <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
                    <p>Humanity would suffer their highs and lows, from small skirmishes to great wars that involved all kingdoms. A little more then fifty years ago, a great cataclism took place, which became known as "The Great Flood". Pouring rains and unnatural tectonic movement took apart the continent, specially the southern regions of Varsemia and Najha. The land was swallowed by the rising seas, turning the once fertile and green prairies into true archipelagos. The surviving humanfolk would take this opportunity to start an age dedicated to seafare.</p>
                    <p>The nations caught by the flood saw their defenses destroyed, their lands swallowed by the oceans. One nation, saw opportunity in the frailty brought by this force of nature and started a age of conquest, slavery and pure despotism. With their main opposers busy with internal conflicts, these conquered great part of the southern regions, thus reaching the current age. An age of rebellion, civil wars and resistance cells.</p>
                    <p>Below is a summarized timeline of Arthan Uthyl in general. The current year is 1175, in the Age of The Restless Waters.</p>
